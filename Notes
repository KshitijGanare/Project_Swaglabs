Key Differences:
@BeforeSuite/@AfterSuite: For actions before and after the entire test suite.
@BeforeClass/@AfterClass: For actions before and after each test class.

Use @BeforeSuite and @AfterSuite for suite-wide setup and teardown, and 
@BeforeClass and @AfterClass for class-specific setup and teardown.
